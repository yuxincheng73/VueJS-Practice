Thin-gauge steel, like sheet metal, can be cut with a large variety of tools. Thicker steel ‚Äì like pipes, tubes and plates ‚Äì may require the use of power saws and torches. Saws and torches can also be used on thin steel, but are impractical choices unless you\'re cutting high volume or need to cut steel often. For best results, wipe off debris from the surface before making cuts. Make your measurements and mark cut lines on the steel to use as guidelines.',
